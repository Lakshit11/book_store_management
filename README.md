# book_store_management
The application uses tkinter to create window in which new books can be added, the availability of specific book can be checked, etc. 
The application uses SQL(local command line) and tkinter to work properly.

P.S : Before executing main file please execute following code in your sql command line.
        "CREATE TABLE BOOKS(ID MEDIUMINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, TITLE TEXT, AUTHOR TEXT, YEAR INTEGER, ISBN INTEGER);"
